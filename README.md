# Profile Card

A simple, accessible, and responsive **Profile Card** built with **semantic HTML**, **modern CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project is part of the **Frontend Wizards Stage 0 challenge**.

---

## Task Overview

The goal was to create a small, testable profile card using **only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, ensuring every visible element has a `data-testid` attribute for automated testing.

## Features

- Semantic HTML structure (`<article>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, etc.)
- Fully responsive layout (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- Accessible (focus styles, alt text, proper headings)
- Time updates dynamically using `Date.now()`
- Social links open safely in new tabs (`target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener noreferrer"`)

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Semantic markup
- **CSS3** — Flexbox + responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — For time updates
